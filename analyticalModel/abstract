The last decades advancement in processor design has lead to increased compute
capabilities, enabling computers to have really high clock speed and high
instruction per clock ratio. However this capability is not matched by the IO
system that didn't saw the same improvement over time. For this reason we must
care most about IO infrastructure to really have good scalability in our
applications.
DDN Storage developed the IME (Infinite Memory Engine) a technology that tries to mitigate this
discrepancy adding an IO layer smaller than the cluster's storage drives.
This is built on top of multiple SSD drives that work with each other increasing
the total size of this buffer. The IME is connected between the cluster IB
fabric and the storage one. It is completely invisible to the applications to be
compatible with all existing code. The IME works like a buffer, able to store
data much faster than the main storage, aiming to complete the transfer quickly.
Then on its own transfer the data received to the main storage, allowing to the
compute node to move forward in the algorithm not caring about slow IO.
The aim of this experiment is to increase the size of the IME building a network
of servers able to manage themselves, designing a fast and lightweight protocol.

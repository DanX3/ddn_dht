\chapter{Performances investigation}\label{sys-analysis}
After the simulator has been completed and tested, the phase of performances
investigation can start. The system has many free parameters that can be set to
get a realistic behaviour of the simulator, but also to investigate its
behaviour in a different condition. \\
The following sections will show the performance difference focusing on a single
parameter, showing how they will affect the total walltime. For each experiment
are done 5 different run with a different value for that field, keeping also the
request done the same.

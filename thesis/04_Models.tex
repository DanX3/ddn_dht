\chapter{Performances investigation}\label{sys-analysis}
After the simulator has been completed and tested, the phase of performances
investigation can start. The system has many free parameters that can be set to
get a realistic behaviour of the simulator, but also to investigate its
behaviour in a different condition. \\
The following sections will show the performance difference focusing on a single
parameter, showing how they will affect the total walltime. For each experiment
are done 5 different run with a different value for that field, keeping also the
same request pattern.
\section{Server count}
In this experiment the aim is to show which benefits can be obtained increasing
the number of servers. The aim of DDN is to be able to make use of thousands of
servers, being able to satisfy a lot of requests at the same time. The whole
setup is the following:
\section{Geometry}
\section{Disk Bandwidth}
\section{Bucket Size}
\section{Read Pattern}
